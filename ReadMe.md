**E-commerce Back-End Development Experience**

During my project, I focused on developing the back-end of an e-commerce website. This involved utilizing Node.js and Express to set up a local server that enabled Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities. Key learning points included:

* **Implementing Node.js and Express:** Gained proficiency in using these technologies to establish and manage a local host server, facilitating effective back-end operations.

* **Database Modeling with MongoDB:** Learned to efficiently model data within a MongoDB database, ensuring robust data management and retrieval.

* **Adhering to MVC Practices:** Developed an understanding of Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, applying it to structure the websiteâ€™s back-end efficiently.

* **Socket Implementation:** Acquired skills in creating sockets using Socket.io to facilitate real-time data exchange between the client and the server, enhancing user interaction and data flow.

This project allowed me to deeply understand and apply various aspects of back-end development in an e-commerce context.
